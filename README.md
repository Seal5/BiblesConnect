# BiblesConnect
- Developed an Android app that allows users to read four different versions of biblical passages simultaneously
- The codebase used model view control (MVC) pattern by allowing BibleModel class to act as the database,
FragmentView class to become the user interface, and BibleNavigation handler to act as the translator
- Implemented dynamic biblical data and view binding adapter using RecyclerView Java class
- A JSON object was used to search for a specific verse in the Bible by using keys with the names of the verses
